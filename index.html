                  their cashflow position and saves recovery costs.

                        Marc is a board member and advisor to MetaDigital. In my current role and for the last 5 years I have been involved in the strategy, strategic planning, marketing, capital raise and growth at VivoSense. Worked diligently and brought initial seed investor to CEO and Chief Business Advisor to secure and complete investment. Working with the finest group of people I have ever known who communicate from N, W, E and S to authentically to find the best way forward. I have over 20 years of International and domestic business experience. Strategic planning, business development, Start-ups, advisor to C-Suite from start-ups to $30 billion plus in revenue. Capital raise, reorganizations, resets and taking an idea, breathing life into it and having the will, endurance and belief to see it through to success. With the right people you can truly accomplish anything.

Created and built a large international business for patient care across the U.S. which managed patients coming to the U.S especially from the MENA region and providing for their needs in and outside the hospital which involved intricate planning, cooperation and partnerships with hospitals in every state. In many cases continued care as they returned back to their countries. Also provided assistance to the governments directly for service and advisory. Had agreements in place with embassies where we were responsible for all their citizens visiting the U.S from the Middle East. My clients are located in every country from Switzerland, Greece, Nigeria, London, UAE, Qatar, Saudi, every continent.

Love writing, reading and recording poetry, all forms of music and the outdoors. Life to me is like the woods. Sometimes there is a path, sometimes its blocked and you have to make new ones, sometimes you get spun around and have no idea where you are at. However,

 A turtle never gets anywhere unless it sticks its neck out.
